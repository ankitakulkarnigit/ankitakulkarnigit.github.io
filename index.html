							<p> Okay, picture this: a girl from Pune, India, graduates undergrad with flying colors, spends two years 
								navigating the corporate jungle at NTT Data, trying to figure out what more is to life than what is already being acheived, 
								then realizes life needs more oomph than masala chai. That's when her adventure began: 
								<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
									<li>Masters in the US &check;</li>
									<li>Startup hustle to sharpen the saw &check; </li>
								</ul>
								Now, at Barclays, exploring the world of bigdata and hadoop, 
								I'm ready for the Silicon Valley adventure. Bay Area dreams simmering, 
								I'm eager to join a team where passion meets purpose and lattes flow freely (okay, maybe sometimes chai too).

								<p> So what's next in life you ask? Well recently life took a turn and I got married in 2023 December! While I love and enjoy my time at my current company unfortunately my life and career goals do not align here and hence I am looking for an opportunity in Bay Area to be closer to my family.
									Besides, what is more appealing than to live a life in the city of tech giants, morning lattes and being closer to family and friends. That being said, if you liked my jouney so far, and if you are looking for someone who is resilient, hard working and a well-grounded developer, please contact me to arrange an interview. 
									I am eager to learn more about how your organization can benefit from my contribution as well as how I can further enhance my knowledge.
